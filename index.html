		<center><p style="font-size:30px">We were assigned to create a website that connected the projects that we completed in Humanities 10 and World History. This is all one big project with the computer science part obviously being the website portion. We used our knowledge of html and css coding to construct this website that shows and connects our projects in a flashy way. In Humanities, we constructed an essay that was based on what our interviewee said during the interview in th history project. For example, my essay was based on divorcement and how it effected the kids. Also, we made a subject portrait of our interviewee. For history we conducted an interview and created a map made in scribble maps, on this map is the places my mom mentioned in the interview.</p></center>
