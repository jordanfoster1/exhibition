		<center><p>Scarred by the hands because of all of their hard work
		Tiny fingers dirtied with mud and murky water
		Their masters telling them to work even harder
		Treated like some type of objects 
		Looking as if they are created projects 

		<p>The rusty buckets that hook onto their fingertips</p>
		All you can hear is the soft footsteps
		Groaning everytime they bend down
		Getting lower and lower to the floor until they cant feel their feet and all they can do is bow 
		The soft breeze filled with smoke
		Kids looking as if they grew up being broke
		Without ever given a second chance
		These kids only get one last glance</p></center>

		<h2>Intro To Project</h2>
		<p>For this project, we had to research a certain topic that had to do with social media. For my project personally, i researched social media and race. I read many articles about racism on social media such as Twitter. I decided to construct my art piece by putting the racist tweets as my backgorund and puttin gthe diversity hands in the middle symbolizing that we are all one whole.</p>
