		<h2>Child Labor Poem</h2>
		<center><p>Scarred by the hands because of all of their hard work<br>
		Tiny fingers dirtied with mud and murky water<br>
		Their masters telling them to work even harder<br>
		Treated like some type of objects<br>
		Looking as if they are created projects<br></p>

		<p>The rusty buckets that hook onto their fingertips<br>
		All you can hear is the soft footsteps<br>
		Groaning everytime they bend down<br>
		Getting lower and lower to the floor until they cant feel their feet and all they can do is bow<br>
		The soft breeze filled with smoke<br>
		Kids looking as if they grew up being broke<br>
		Without ever given a second chance<br>
		These kids only get one last glance</p></center>

		<h2>Intro To Project</h2>
		<p>For this project, we had to research a certain topic that had to do with social media. For my project personally, i researched social media and race. I read many articles about racism on social media such as Twitter. The reason I chose this topic specifaclly is because I feel as if it isn't talked about enough and should be discussed more at schools and all around in general. I decided to construct my art piece by putting the racist tweets as my backgorund and puttin gthe diversity hands in the middle symbolizing that we are all one whole.</p>

		<h2>Social Media Poem: Unite</h2>
		<center><p>Left, lost, and lonely<br>
		When all people of color want is to just be holy<br>
		Pictures and posts about black people being monkeys<br>
		People treating us as little punkies<br>
		Make this world a better place<br>
		Keep that stuff to yourself and say that in your own space<br></p>

		<center><p>Unfair, mistreated, and speechless<br>
		As everyone just watches eating peaches<br>
		Tired of the shit that people have to say<br>
		When all black people want is to say hey<br>
		Why can’t we just be treated with love<br>
		Instead of being dirtied like a glove<br>
		Why can’t we just make a song together<br>
		Why can’t we just go to the mall together<br></p></center>
