		<h2>Portrait Reflection</h2>
		<p>I chose the images that I did because I wanted the pictures to match my mom’s interests and wanted to put most of the things that made my mom, my mom. I put pictures of her favorite teams because she is a big basketball and baseball fan and her favorite player of all time is Blake Griffin. Her man crush of baseball is Andre Ethier that’s why I decided to put that one too. Well, we only needed one historical moment image to connect to our interviewee so I chose Tupac’s death. The year that my mom graduated high school, Tupac was shot and killed when he was driving down the street. Finally, I placed the images in certain places to kind of categorize them and make it more sensible to blend in with each other. I put the dodger things in one corner so they could blend in easier and it would just look more clean. Also, I placed Blake Griffin near the clipper logo because he plays for that team and it just made sense to put him there. The images that are bigger are the ones that mean the most to my mom and the ones that are smaller mean something but just not as much as the big photos and show my mom more.</p>
