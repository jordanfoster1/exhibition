		<h2>Intro to Project</h2>
		<center><p>For this project, we were assigned to research on and execute a press release for a given Industrial Revolution invention. For my project, I did research on the threshing machine. I learned about the process of it, the historical impact of it, and how it overall benefitted society back in the Industrial Revolution. Below are the presentations and the links of my sketch and my 3-D model of the threshing mahine that we created. If you want the full version of the project presentation then click on the home pag of the slides and it will direct you to the slides. All of our information on the threshing machine is on here as well.</p></center>

		<h2>Process of Creating 3-D Model</h2>
		<p>There were steps to creating this masterpiece of a model. First we sketched out what the actual model would look like and how would we want to design it. Then we discussed what materials were needed to actually construct the model. We went out to get supplies and decided to put the model on a little farm because it gave it sort of that 19th century, Industrial Revolution feel. We hot glued everything together and had it being pulled by a horse because that is what they used to pull the threshing machine. Finally, we added little mini affects with the grass and the gardening tools kind of laying around the farm.</p>
