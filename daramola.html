			<h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
	
			<p>Jordan F: This is Jordan Foster and I'll be interviewing my mom Lisa Foster and today I'll be talking about what your childhood was like in the past, our first question is when and where were you born.</p>

			<p>Lisa F: I was born at Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood California July 13th 1978.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Where did you grow up?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: I grew up in Los Angeles California.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: The next question is what is your choice what was your childhood like and give a special memory that you have.</p>

			<p>Lisa F: My childhood was very crowded I am one of seven kids and with the exception of the last two we're all only a few years apart and the memory that I'm probably most known for amongst my family is the night that I woke up, heard noises in the garage, went out there, caught my uncle and his best friend putting our bikes together on Christmas Eve and I came to the realization that there was no Santa Claus so I politely told my brothers and sisters that I woke up that there was no Santa Claus. I did totally ruin their Christmas and that's probably the most notable story I guess when we talk about our childhood.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Next question is who did you turn for help when you need it?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: My mom's brother, her only brother my Uncle Anthony, I was the closest to and he always had great advice and never sugarcoat it anything he always gave it to you straight and honest.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Next question is what was it like growing up with divorced parents?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: I was fortunate enough that even though my parents were not together they were still really really good friends in fact today they're still very close friends so it wasn't bad I mean there were times where I wanted to be with my dad that I had to be with my mom but for the most part we still did a lot of stuff together and my parents both did stuff together with as a family so the experience wasn't as bad as it could have been.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Now the next question is what is your ethnic background? Answer the next question where is your mom's family from where's your dad's family from and have you ever been there? What was the experience like?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: I have only been to the airport there to catch a connecting flight but I plan on going there this year my mom's parents are from Oklahoma her grandparents originally immigrated from duritz on Italy and I have not been there but hopefully one day I will.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Next question what are the most important lessons you learned in life where did these events happen?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: I’ve always been a leader, most of this I learned growing up in school just being around certain friends, I kind of hung around the Mean Girls in middle school and high school and just to watch how you treat people and how it could just totally affect them in a negative light was just very important was always important for me you never know how someone stays going or what they do with that home so it's always be nice to everyone and I would never be a follower in life in general.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: Second to last question how has your life been different than what you’d imagine?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: Well I thought I was going to be a gymnast who only adopted hundreds of dogs instead I ended up with two children which when I was younger was never in my future but of course I am, I think they're amazing and I love them and I'm glad I decided to raise children and dogs.</p>

			<p>Jordan F: And onto the final question what is a moment in history that you personally remember? Why?</p>

			<p>Lisa F: Most exciting thing when I was 6 years old, 7 years old, was the Olympics Los Angeles I went to the track and field Olympics and that was like huge for me it always you know you see that stuff on TV but actually have it there and go to the event that was a big deal for me as far as historical.</p>
